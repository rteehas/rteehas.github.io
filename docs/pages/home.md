I am a current PhD student at NYU's Center for Data Science, advised by Professor [Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/). I am broadly interested in questions related to abstraction and reasoning in deep learning models. Prior to my PhD, I was involved in open-source deep learning research, contributing to [Eleuther AI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) and serving as the Co-Chair of the Interpretability and Visualization Working Group in the [HuggingFace BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) program.
