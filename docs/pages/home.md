**Update: In the Fall, I will be starting a PhD at the NYU Center for Data Science, where I will be advised by [Mengye Ren](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mren/)**!

Hi! I am a software engineer at Charles River Analytics and Visiting Student at the TTIC, where I am advised by Professor [Bradly Stadie](https://bstadie.github.io/). I am broadly interested in building machines with human-like reasoning ability. To do so, I think it is important to understand the role language and communication play in human reasoning, and to explore how they can be used to build general purpose machine intelligence. I am currently investigating how language can be leveraged as abstraction to encode complex goals, actions, and tasks (particularly in RL and program synthesis).

My work at CRA has touched on Monte-Carlo Methods, probabilistic programming, NLP, and full-stack development. Outside of industry, I split my time as an open-source contributer to [Eleuther AI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) and the Co-Chair of the Interpretability and Visualization Working Group in the [HuggingFace BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) program. At HuggingFace, our group is studying the training dynamics and emergent properties of Large Language Models, and we are always looking for new contributors. At Eleuther, I am leading a project on building natural language rationales for incremental code changes. Check out our ongoing work in the **#contrastive** channel on the Eleuther Discord, and feel free to join in. 

Take a look at some of my projects [here](rteehas.github.io/projects/)!
