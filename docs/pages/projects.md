## Open Source

- [Google BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) (Collaboration with Vinay Prabhu and Nick Roberts)
  - [Ruin A Name With One Edit](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/ruin_names_task_multiple_choice), a task to assess whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify humor
  - [Hyperbaton Indentification](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/hyperbaton_task_multiple_choice), a task using the inversion of normal word order (hyperbaton) and reference resolution to test LLM robustness
  - [Kannada Riddles](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/kannada_json_task), a task using riddles in the Kannada language to measure LLMs' abilities to understand riddle clues in a 'low-resource' language
- EleutherAI
  - [Equivariance in Machine Learning](https://github.com/EleutherAI/equivariance)
  - Contrastive Learning for Code Review
  - Interpreting Large Language Models Across Time
- [HuggingFace BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/en/#!index.md), working on developing a multilingual LLM in coordination with an international group of scientists. I'm a member of the following working groups:
  - Modeling
  - Evaluation
    - Subgroup on Few-Shot Generalization, focusing on evaluation tasks for analogical reasoning, symbolic rules-based generalization, linguistic rules-based generalization, and compositionality
  - Interpretability
    - Organizing a subgroup to analyze training dynamics and emergent structures in LLMs
- [NL-Augmenter](https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/NL-Augmenter) (Collaboration with Vinay Prabhu, Sang Han, and Nick Roberts)
  - [Yoda Transform](https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/NL-Augmenter/tree/main/transformations/yoda_transform)
  - [Gender Neopronoun Substitution](https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/NL-Augmenter/tree/main/transformations/gender_neopronouns)
  - [Pig Latin](https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/NL-Augmenter/tree/0c96e8f0e9cbc0e7268419802d66a7ed116e9e9f/transformations/pig_latin)

## Non-Open Source

- **SNAPPR**
  - Condition-based maintenance for complex machinery using Monte-Carlo Tree Search combined with probabilistic models in the **Figaro** probabilistic programming language

## Research Proposals

- **PRESCRIPTION**
  - I contributed the probabilistic modeling section to a SBIR proposal to modeling pharmaceutical supply chains, which was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency in mid-November 2020.
  - In 2021, using the **Pyro** probabilistic programming language, I constructed models for essential drugs and currently am working on automatic inference of missing nodes in the supply chain

## Service

I co-organized the ML Collective [social](https://mlcollective.org/iclr-2021-open-collab-social/) at ICLR, focusing on open science research in machine learning
